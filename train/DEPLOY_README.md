## Deploying a Trained Policy

This document describes the recommended process for deploying a trained LeRobot policy to a Franka setup.

The intended topology is:

- run policy inference on a server or GPU workstation
- run the real-time executor on the computer connected to the robot
- use the ROS 2 bridge on the robot machine to publish live observations and receive execution commands

This split is safer because:

- the robot machine stays focused on low-latency IO, safety checks, and command execution
- the inference machine can use a larger GPU and heavier models
- server restarts do not directly disturb the robot-side control process

## Deployment Flow

Use this order:

1. inspect the checkpoint and confirm the dataset contract
2. start the policy server on the inference machine
3. start the four ROS 2 launch groups on the robot machine
4. start the executor in dry-run mode on the robot machine
5. verify that observations and predictions look correct
6. restart the executor with `--execute` only after dry-run looks safe

The four Robot-Host ROS 2 launch groups are:

1. `franka_fr3_arm_controllers ... deployment_mode:=true`
2. `franka_gripper_manager`
3. `franka_realsense_camera_publisher`
4. `franka_lerobot_data_bridge ... deployment_duo.yaml`

The first launch group includes the Franka hardware bringup,
`robot_state_publisher`, `joint_state_publisher`, `ros2_control`, and the
deployment-gated joint controller. Do not start `franka_gello_state_publisher`
during policy deployment.

To supervise these four groups from one Robot-Host terminal, use:

```bash
cd ~/real-exp
bash scripts/start_deployment_duo.sh
```

This starts the groups in dependency order and does not start the policy server
or ACT/Diffusion executor. Before opening either Franka connection, it validates
that the installed ROS packages come from this repository's overlay, parses the
installed YAML files, checks that ports `5555` and `5556` are free, and rejects
an existing controller, bridge, or GELLO collection stack. During startup it
requires fresh arm, gripper, and camera messages; verifies that both deployment
controllers are loaded `inactive`; and verifies that the bridge is using
`deployment_duo.yaml`, `deployment_state_source=topics`, and STANDBY mode.

Run only the non-hardware checks with:

```bash
bash scripts/start_deployment_duo.sh --preflight-only
```

The script homes the two gripper clients sequentially because simultaneous
startup has previously caused one homing action to time out. Ctrl-C first asks
the bridge to return to STANDBY, waits for both deployment controllers to become
inactive, and then stops bridge, cameras, grippers, and arm bringup in reverse
order. Manual four-terminal commands remain available below.

## What Runs Where

Policy server machine:

- load the trained checkpoint
- receive observations over the network
- run policy inference
- return action chunks

Robot-connected machine:

- read robot joint state, gripper state, and camera frames
- build observations in the same format used during training
- send observations to the policy server
- receive action chunks
- convert policy actions into Franka-safe commands
- enforce joint position, velocity, and acceleration limits by default; `--no-limit` is the explicit opt-out
- enforce watchdog timeout and abort handling locally

ROS 2 bridge on the robot machine:

- subscribe to robot joint states, gripper state, gripper commands, and RGB cameras
- publish synchronized live packets over ZMQ for the executor
- receive command packets for deployment execution
- keep the live observation and action dimensions aligned with the training dataset contract

The ROS 2 bridge does not create robot or gripper state by itself.
It republishes already-running ROS topics into the ZMQ format expected by the policy executor.
For the default Franka duo setup, start the robot and gripper bringup before starting the bridge.

## End-to-End Procedure

### 1. Inspect the checkpoint

Run this on the machine that has the checkpoint and the `lerobot` environment:

```bash
python train/deploy_lerobot_policy.py \
  inspect \
  --policy-path outputs/pick_and_place_test_act/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model
```

Inspecting before deployment is recommended because it prints:

- the policy type
- the recommended `actions_per_chunk`
- the dataset state and action dimensions
- the expected camera keys
- the recorded action representation

Verify that:

- `dataset_fps` is `15`
- `dataset_state_dim` is `16`
- `dataset_action_dim` is `16`
- `dataset_image_keys` are `observation.images.cam_left`, `observation.images.cam_front`, `observation.images.cam_right`
- `dataset_action_representation` says `arm=absolute_joint_position, gripper=absolute_width`

### 2. Start the camera publisher

Start the RealSense camera publisher:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_realsense_camera_publisher cameras.launch.py
```

The default camera publisher config is:

- `gello_software/ros2/src/franka_realsense_camera_publisher/config/example_three_cameras.yaml`

If `camera_1_serial`, `camera_2_serial`, or `camera_3_serial` are left empty, the node auto-assigns detected RealSense devices in sorted serial-number order.
For stable camera-to-name mapping, set those serial numbers explicitly in the YAML.

Make sure the publisher exposes the camera topics expected by training before starting the bridge.

### 3. Start the ROS 2 bridge

Before launching the bridge, check the selected bridge config and make sure it matches training:

- `include_right_arm`
- `include_gripper`
- `left_robot_ip`, `right_robot_ip`
- `command_host`, `command_port`
- `left_deployment_joint_command_topic`, `right_deployment_joint_command_topic`
- `left_deployment_gripper_command_topic`, `right_deployment_gripper_command_topic`
- `camera_1_name`, `camera_2_name`, `camera_3_name`
- camera topic names

For the default dual-arm deployment setup:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_lerobot_data_bridge bridge.launch.py config_file:=deployment_duo.yaml
```

For single-arm deployment:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_lerobot_data_bridge bridge.launch.py config_file:=deployment_single.yaml
```

For the default dataset, the live bridge should publish:

- 16-dimensional robot state
- 16-dimensional action packets
- three RGB cameras named `cam_left`, `cam_front`, and `cam_right`

The deployment bridge starts in `STANDBY` mode by default.
In standby it can publish hold commands to the ROS 2 controller topics, but it does not publish live ZMQ observation packets until deployment is activated.

### 4. Start the policy server on the inference machine

Run:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train/deploy_lerobot_policy.py \
  server \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080 \
  --fps 15
```

If needed, set:

- `--port` to a different gRPC port
- `--inference-latency` to your target server-side inference budget
- `--obs-queue-timeout` if you need a different observation timeout

### 5. Start the ROS 2 arm and gripper consumers for live execution

If you only want dry-run inference, skip this step until you are ready to move the robot.

For live execution, start the existing controller stack in deployment-gated mode:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_fr3_arm_controllers franka_fr3_arm_controllers.launch.py \
  robot_config_file:=example_fr3_duo_config.yaml \
  deployment_mode:=true
```

and:

```bash
ros2 launch franka_gripper_manager franka_gripper_client.launch.py config_file:=example_fr3_duo_config_franka_hand.yaml
```

In `deployment_mode:=true`, `joint_impedance_controller` holds the current arm pose until the bridge explicitly enables deployment control.
The bridge republishes policy actions to these existing topics:

- `/left/deployment/joint_states`
- `/right/deployment/joint_states`
- `/left/gripper/gripper_client/target_gripper_width_percent`
- `/right/gripper/gripper_client/target_gripper_width_percent`

This lets the existing ROS 2 consumers be reused during deployment.
By default, gripper actions are continuous open-width percentages in `[0, 1]`.
To switch back to latched binary gripper commands, update both `GRIPPER_COMMAND_MODE` in `gello_publisher.py` and `GRIPPER_ACTION_REPRESENTATION` in `lerobot_data_bridge.py` to `binary_open_close` before collecting or deploying matching data.

### 6. Start the executor in dry-run mode

Run this on the robot machine:

```bash
python train/franka_act_policy_executor.py \
  --policy-path outputs/pick_and_place_test_act/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
  --server-address 192.168.50.6:8080 \
  --zmq-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --zmq-port 5555 \
  --fps 15 \
  --task "pick and place"
```

If you want to control how overlapping action chunks are blended, add:

```bash
--act-aggregate-ratio-old 0.8
```

This ACT-specific flag sets the weight of the already-queued action when the executor receives a new action for the same timestep:

- blended action = `old_ratio * old + (1 - old_ratio) * new`
- valid range is `0.0` to `1.0`
- `0.0` means fully replace the queued action with the new action
- `1.0` means keep the queued action and ignore the new action at overlapping timesteps
- the default is `0.8`

For diffusion deployment, use the diffusion-specific knobs instead:

```bash
python train/franka_diffusion_policy_executor.py \
  --policy-path outputs/pick_and_place_test_diffusion/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
  --actions-per-chunk 8 \
  --server-address 192.168.50.6:8080 \
  --zmq-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --zmq-port 5555 \
  --fps 15 \
  --task "pick and place" \
  --diffusion-chunk-size-threshold 0.5 \
  --diffusion-aggregate-ratio-old 0.5
```

If the checkpoint exists only on the policy server machine and not on the robot computer, pass:

- `--policy-path` as the path on the server machine
- `--actions-per-chunk` explicitly

Example:

```bash
python train/franka_diffusion_policy_executor.py \
  --policy-path /home/pair/real-exp/outputs/policy-dir \
  --actions-per-chunk 8 \
  --policy-device cuda:0 \
  --server-address 192.168.50.6:8080 \
  --zmq-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --zmq-port 5555 \
  --fps 15 \
  --task "pick and place" \
  --diffusion-chunk-size-threshold 0.5 \
  --diffusion-aggregate-ratio-old 0.5
```

### 7. Validate dry-run before moving the robot

What should happen:

- the executor waits for the first ZMQ packet from the ROS 2 bridge
- it prints the live `state_dim`, `action_dim`, and camera names
- it checks that live `action_dim` matches the dataset action dimension
- it tells the remote server which checkpoint to load
- it starts printing predicted actions instead of moving the robot

Do not move on to live execution until all of the following look correct:

- camera streams are live
- the task string is correct
- predicted actions are finite and stable
- the policy responds continuously without large delays
- no dimension mismatch or missing camera errors appear

If the executor raises an `action_dim` mismatch, fix the ROS 2 bridge configuration so the live stream matches the dataset used for training.

### 8. Restart the executor with `--execute`

Once dry-run is stable, restart the executor for live execution:

```bash
python train/franka_act_policy_executor.py \
  --policy-path outputs/pick_and_place_test_act/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
  --server-address 192.168.50.6:8080 \
  --zmq-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --zmq-port 5555 \
  --command-zmq-host 127.0.0.1 \
  --command-zmq-port 5556 \
  --fps 15 \
  --task "pick and place" \
  --act-aggregate-ratio-old 0.8 \
  --policy-start \
  --execute
```

The limiter is enabled by default on both the ACT and diffusion executors. The
legacy `--limit` flag remains accepted but is now redundant. Only `--no-limit`
disables time-stretching and restores direct valid-target command generation.
With the default limiter active, each absolute arm target is checked against the
FR3 joint position range (with a `0.02 rad` margin). A target segment that would
exceed the configured velocity or acceleration envelope is expanded into multiple
15 Hz command steps using a quintic trajectory; a segment already inside the
envelope remains one step.

The limiter uses `80%` of the FR3 interface velocity and acceleration limits:

- velocity: `[2.096, 2.096, 2.096, 2.096, 4.208, 3.344, 4.208] rad/s`
- acceleration: `8.0 rad/s^2` on every joint

The two arms are checked independently against the same seven-joint limits. Gripper
commands are emitted only on the final step of a stretched segment. NaN, infinity,
and out-of-range arm targets stop the executor before that target is sent. Every
generated step is recorded as `action_limit_step` in `samples.jsonl`; a terminal
line such as `1 -> 6 control steps` means that policy segment was stretched.

For diffusion, live execution is limited by default as well:

```bash
python train/franka_diffusion_policy_executor.py \
  ... \
  --execute
```

Use `--no-limit` only for an intentional comparison or diagnosis where direct
valid-target command generation is required.

Both ACT and diffusion executors support two mutually exclusive startup target
sources:

- `--policy-start` obtains the first policy action from the current observation.
- `--episode-start` selects a random dataset episode and uses its frame-0
  `observation.state`.
- `--episode-start 12` selects episode 12. Add
  `--episode-start-frame-index N` only when a frame other than 0 is intentional.

Both modes use the already-running deployment bridge and ROS controller. They
approach the selected absolute joint target with the same conservative quintic
trajectory, wait for both arms to settle, discard stale policy actions, and resume
from a fresh inference request. Do not stop the four ROS deployment launch groups
or run the direct `pylibfranka` initializer for this executor flow.

For example, the command above can use a random episode start by replacing
`--policy-start` with:

```bash
--episode-start \
--execute
```

`--episode-start` requires the dataset parquet files under
`DATASET_ROOT/data/chunk-*/*.parquet` on the Robot Host. It does not require the
dataset videos. Startup alignment and default action time-stretching work together
with `--policy-start --execute` or `--episode-start [INDEX] --execute`. Older
commands that also include `--limit` remain valid. Add `--no-limit` to opt out.

Live execution ordering should be:

1. start the arm bringup with `deployment_mode:=true`
2. start the gripper manager
3. start the camera publisher
4. start the bridge with `deployment_duo.yaml` or `deployment_single.yaml`
5. start the remote policy server
6. start the executor with `--execute`
7. let the executor auto-activate the bridge before the first command

With the current executor flow, you do not need to call `/set_deployment_active` manually for live execution unless you explicitly pass `--no-auto-activate-bridge`.

The executor will:

- split the policy action into left and right arm and gripper components
- interpret arm actions using the trained dataset layout
- send `absolute_joint_position` arm actions directly as robot joint targets
- send those targets to the bridge command socket
- let the bridge enable the deployment-gated arm controllers and republish targets to the existing ROS 2 arm and gripper topics

Important live-control caveats:

- the ROS 2 bridge needs upstream camera topics and Franka joint-state topics from the arm bringup
- the current deployment execute path is intended to use the ROS 2 controller stack, not direct active `pylibfranka` control
- do not start the GELLO publisher or publish conflicting targets to `/left/deployment/joint_states` or `/right/deployment/joint_states`

If you want to keep bridge activation manual during execution, pass `--no-auto-activate-bridge` to the executor and then call:

```bash
ros2 service call /set_deployment_active std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"
```

The bridge only enables the deployment-gated arm controllers after it receives the first real command packet from the executor.
Keep `deployment_state_source: topics` in `deployment_duo.yaml` while the ROS 2
controller stack is active. The bridge reads `/left/right/franka/joint_states`
and publishes policy targets to `/left/right/deployment/joint_states`.

### 9. Tune only if needed

Useful executor options:

- `--actions-per-chunk` to override the chunk length requested from the server
- `--policy-device` to tell the remote policy server which device to use
- `--act-chunk-size-threshold` and `--act-aggregate-ratio-old` on `franka_act_policy_executor.py` to tune overlapping ACT chunks
- `--diffusion-chunk-size-threshold` and `--diffusion-aggregate-ratio-old` on `franka_diffusion_policy_executor.py` to tune overlapping diffusion chunks
- `--diffusion-noise-scheduler-type` and `--diffusion-num-inference-steps` on the server to override diffusion denoising at load time
- `--limit` on either executor as a backward-compatible explicit spelling of the default limiter behavior
- `--no-limit` on either executor to disable time-stretching and send valid targets directly
- `--policy-start` on either executor to align to the first policy target and then re-infer
- `--episode-start [INDEX]` on either executor to align to a random or selected dataset episode start and then re-infer
- `--command-zmq-host` and `--command-zmq-port` to match the bridge command socket
- `--bridge-activation-service` to override the ROS 2 `SetBool` service used for bridge activation
- `--no-auto-activate-bridge` to keep bridge activation manual

## Common Failure Modes

- `action_dim` mismatch:
  - the live ROS 2 bridge config does not match the dataset used for training
- missing camera keys:
  - live camera names differ from the dataset camera feature names
- `Repo id must be in the form ...` on the server:
  - the server cannot find the checkpoint path locally
  - pass `--policy-path` as the path on the server machine, not the robot machine
- no ZMQ packets received:
  - the ROS 2 bridge is not running, not publishing, or is bound to a different host or port
- gRPC connection errors:
  - the executor cannot reach the policy server at `--server-address`
- `failed to connect to all addresses` or `No route to host`:
  - the server IP is wrong or the two machines are not on a reachable network
  - verify with `ping <server-ip>` and `nc -vz <server-ip> 8080`
- `CUDA error: invalid device ordinal` on the server:
  - the checkpoint config and requested runtime device disagree
  - start the server with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` and use `--policy-device cuda:0`
- `stack expects a non-empty TensorList` on the server:
  - the policy did not receive a valid stacked image batch
  - confirm the live bridge publishes all cameras from the training contract and restart `python train/deploy_lerobot_policy.py server ...`
- `Action receiver RPC error: Channel closed!` on the robot machine:
  - the server usually crashed while handling inference
  - check the server log first and fix the upstream error there
- executor appears to hang after the first packet when using `--execute`:
  - make sure you are using the ROS 2 bridge execution backend and that `franka_fr3_arm_controllers` is running
  - the executor forwards actions to the bridge command socket instead of using direct active `pylibfranka` control
- executor waits forever at `Waiting for the first ZMQ packet...` in deployment dry-run:
  - expected if the bridge is still in `STANDBY`
  - call `ros2 service call /set_deployment_active std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"`
  - live execution with `--execute` auto-activates the bridge unless `--no-auto-activate-bridge` is set
- `Waiting for fresh deployment joint targets...` from `deployment_joint_impedance_controller`:
  - the controller is not receiving fresh `/left/right/deployment/joint_states`
  - for live ROS 2 deployment, launch the bridge with `deployment_duo.yaml` or `deployment_single.yaml`
  - rebuild and source the ROS 2 workspace before relaunching
- `franka_robot_state_broadcaster` fails with `State interface with key 'fr3/robot_state' does not exist`:
  - this has been observed in the current setup during controller bringup
  - if `joint_state_broadcaster` and `joint_impedance_controller` still configure successfully, deployment can still proceed
- `zmq.error.Again: Resource temporarily unavailable` on the robot machine:
  - the bridge did not publish a fresh packet before the ZMQ receive timeout
  - the patched executor now skips that cycle and waits for the next packet
- robot does not move in dry-run:
  - expected because dry-run prints predicted actions and does not command Franka

## Franka Control Note

The dataset action representation is absolute joint position for the arms, with optional gripper commands.
That means the robot-side executor can send policy arm outputs to the deployment bridge as joint targets, while still keeping local safety checks and the ROS 2 controller layer in the loop.

The executor should interpret actions using the same structure as the dataset:

- 16-dim: `[Left Arm(7), Left Gripper(1), Right Arm(7), Right Gripper(1)]`
- 14-dim: `[Left Arm(7), Right Arm(7)]`

In practice, the executor should:

- command absolute joint targets through the deployment bridge
- reject invalid positions and time-stretch over-limit segments by default; only `--no-limit` disables time-stretching
- stop safely if server responses are delayed or missing
